# Tweaky

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beequeue/tweaky.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/beequeue/tweaky)

Tweaky will be a library and domain-specific language in JSON notation allowing for the custom transformation of JSON payloads.  It is more concerned with altering values than altering form.

__Early stages warning - this warning will be removed when there is something working :)__
